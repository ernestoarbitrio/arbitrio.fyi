#### Ciao! 👋

I am *Ernesto Arbitrio* a 🇮🇹 Software Engineer turned *Senior* Software Engineer when I turned 36 😏.

Maybe we have met each other on Twitter [@__pamaron__](https://twitter.com/__pamaron__) or GitHub [@ernestoarbitrio](https://github.com/ernestoarbitrio>) before.

Considering I do not use social networks often, so you probably don't know me! Let me introduce myself: 
I build analytics software products for a living, I started programming Python in 2008, sometimes I do speak at PyCon conferences.

#### Personal Projects 📒

Beside my professional projects I also invest some of my spare time in personal projects:

 - [Histolab](https://github.com/histolab/histolab>) a library for Digital Pathology Image Processing.


#### Speaking 📢

I have been speaking for several years at PyCon Italia, PyData and Europython and also some meetups (Pytrento, Python Pizza).
You can find some of the slides for my talks [here](https://speakerdeck.com/pamaron).

#### Short Bio 👤

I am a Python passionate (almost addicted).
